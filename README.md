# Performance-Evaluation-Based-On-WebCodecs
## todo
- [x] Generate a serial of 1080P RGBA images
- [x] Used the WebCodecs API to encode these generated images (with configured bitrate & frame rate)
- [ ] Record the average encode cost time 
- [x] Record total encode cost time
- [ ] Return a boolean value if the average encode cost time less or more than max threshold .
- [ ] Add the following variables: {bitrate, frame rate, key frame number, frame difference}
- [ ] Involve webworker
