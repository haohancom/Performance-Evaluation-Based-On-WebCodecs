- Generate a serial of 1080P RGBA images
- Convert these images to YUV format 
- Used the WebCodecs API to encode these generated YUV images (with configured bitrate & frame rate)
- Record the average encode cost time 
- Return a boolean value if the average encode cost time less or more than max threshold .
